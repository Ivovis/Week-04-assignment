create the monorepo with basic static client and server

Use existing database and create a dedicated table for the guestbook
    build the table in the queries.sql file and find out how to use it on the supabase site - nm just copy and paste.

research SQL 

    -- Insert a new comment into the guestbook

    format for dummy data

    INSERT INTO guestbook (guestName, guestComment) VALUES
    ('John Doe', 'This is a great guestbook!'),
    ('Jane Smith', 'I love this place!'),
    ('Alice Johnson', 'Thanks for the wonderful service!');

    maybe use a seed.js file for this and have > 30 entries created by GPT4all using lama3 model.


    retrieve all comments from the guestbook    - SELECT * FROM guestbook;
    retrieve comments in descending order       - SELECT * FROM guestbook ORDER BY id DESC;
    retrieve comments in ascending order        - SELECT * FROM guestbook ORDER BY id ASC;
