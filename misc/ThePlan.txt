create the monorepo with basic static client and server

Use existing database and create a dedicated table for the guestbook
    build the table in the queries.sql file and find out how to use it on the supabase site - nm just copy and paste.

research SQL 

    -- Insert a new comment into the guestbook

    format for dummy data

    INSERT INTO guestbook (guestName, guestComment) VALUES
    ('John Doe', 'This is a great guestbook!'),
    ('Jane Smith', 'I love this place!'),
    ('Alice Johnson', 'Thanks for the wonderful service!');

    maybe use a seed.js file for this and have > 30 entries created by GPT4all using lama3 model.


    retrieve all comments from the guestbook    - SELECT * FROM guestbook;
    retrieve comments in descending order       - SELECT * FROM guestbook ORDER BY id DESC;
    retrieve comments in ascending order        - SELECT * FROM guestbook ORDER BY id ASC;


1. create project - done

2. create database/table with dummy data - done

3. file checkpoint (update readme.md, create the repo, push the work so far) - done

4. create the client wireframe - done

5. get the client created with basic elements - done

6. create the server post route to add new comment to the database

7. create the server get route for the current database so the client can ask for the current list of past comments

8. add CSS
    I've added in the delete button just for styling.

9. add delete button
    and server route to handle delete.

10. add like button
    this will need an update to the database with a default of 0 on record creation
