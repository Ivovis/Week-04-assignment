    Checkpoint 1: 2025 05 22 1419

    I have created the monorepo with client and server, added basic files to the server, Including the following.

    - queries.sql - defines the table creation, I copied and pasted this into the supaBase online sql editor, dropped the table after I first created it to add quotes to the table and column names so it correctly used my capitalisation.
    - seed.js - Created a list of dummy data using an AI assistant - just the array, then used JS to place the dummy data into the database, proving the connection string and my JS code were correct.

    - added this file, and will now create the repo on github and push my work for this checkpoint.

    Checkpoint 2: 2025 05 22 1531

    Completed basic client, its currently complaining because the servers not been done yet, but it is reporting the form data to the console correctly, looks like I'm developing this like eating a lion bar from both ends at once!.
